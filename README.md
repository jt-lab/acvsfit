# acvsfit
A library for fitting data from Adaptive Choice Visual Search experiments and for conducting a full-fledged Bayesian analysis

## Notes:
* Some (plotting) functions might take the input data frame as an argument, even though they are not plotting any of the raw data. This is becaue labels, such as names of the target types, are extracted from the input data and used for labeling plots.
